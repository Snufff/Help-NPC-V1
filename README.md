Installation

1. Extract the zip file.

CHANGING MODEL

If you would like to change the model of the NPC, you can do so in help_npc>lua>entities>helpnpc_npc>init.lua

Support

As this is a free release, I do not offer support. However, if there is something you REALLY need to ask, add me on Steam (www.steamcommunity.com/id/shaunthehuman)

Notice

As with all NPC based addons, playermodels will not work for the NPC model. They will be T Posed, not animated.
